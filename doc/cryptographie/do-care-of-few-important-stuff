don't give a fuck make you an asshole but set you free

care of anything make you someone who can't take the lead

care of few thing make you a leader

stop try to explain and justify

people follow you their own way

don't force anyone

clear life philosophy

just live you life

what matter to me and what does not matter


create a community of polymath creator


action and word are aligment


Care more of something else

Live your philosophy without forcing other

articulate it with conviction


The thing you own end up owning you

care of well-being of people

add gratitude and fullfilment
