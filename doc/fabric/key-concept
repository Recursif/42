#Intro

Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distribued
ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture
delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency,
flexibility and scalability.

Distributed ledger that records all the tx that takes place on the network

append-only, using crypto techniques that guarantee that tx can't be modified

# Smart contract

smart contracts provides controlled access to the ledger

smart-contacts are not only a key mechanism for encapsulating information and keeping it simple accross the network,
they can also be written to allow participants to execute certain aspects of tx automatically.

A smart contract can, for example, be written to stipulate the cost of shipping
an item that changes depending on when it arrives.

With the terms agreed to by both parties and written to the ledger, the appropriate funds change hands automatically when the item is received.

# Consensus

The process of keeping the ledger tx synchronized across the network
to ensure that ledgers update only when tx are approved the appropriate participants,
and that when ledgers do update, they update with the same tx in the same order.


Hyperledger Fabric provides a membership identity service that manages user IDs and


Hyperledger Fabric assigns network roles by node type.

To provide concurrency and parallelism to the network, transaction execution is separated from transaction ordering and commitment.


so processes on one can run independently of verification by the other.
