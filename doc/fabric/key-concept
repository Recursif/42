# Intro

Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distribued
ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture
delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency,
flexibility and scalability.

Distributed ledger that records all the tx that takes place on the network

append-only, using crypto techniques that guarantee that tx can't be modified



## Smart contract

smart contracts provides controlled access to the ledger

smart-contacts are not only a key mechanism for encapsulating information and keeping it simple accross the network,
they can also be written to allow participants to execute certain aspects of tx automatically.

A smart contract can, for example, be written to stipulate the cost of shipping
an item that changes depending on when it arrives.

With the terms agreed to by both parties and written to the ledger,
the appropriate funds change hands automatically when the item is received.



## Consensus

The process of keeping the ledger tx synchronized across the network
to ensure that ledgers update only when tx are approved the appropriate participants,
and that when ledgers do update, they update with the same tx in the same order.

Hyperledger Fabric provides a membership identity service that manages user IDs.

Hyperledger Fabric assigns network roles by node type.

To provide concurrency and parallelism to the network,
transaction execution is separated from transaction ordering and commitment.

so processes on one can run independently of verification by the other.



## Fonctionalities

Identity management

Privacy and confidentiality

Efficient processing

Chaincode functionality

Chaincode applications encode logic that is invoked by specific types of transactions on the channel.

Modular design



## Model

Assets:
  Asset definition enable the exchange of almost anything
  with monetary value over the network.

  Assets are represented in Hyperledger Fabric as a collection of key-value pairs,
  with state changes recorded as transactions on a Channel ledger.
  Assets can be represented in binary and/or JSON form.

Chaincode:
  Chaincode execution is partitioned from tx
  ordering, limiting the required levels of trust and verification
  across node types, and optimizing network scabilibility and performance.

  Chaincode is software defining an asset or assets,
  and the transaction instructions for modifying the asset(s).

Leadger features:
  Thes immutable, shared ledger encodes tx history for each channel
  and includes SQL-like query capability for efficient auditing and dispute resolution.

Privacy through Channels:
  Channels enable multi-lateral transactions with the high degrees of privacy and confidentiality

Security and Membership Services:
  Permissionnned Membership
  provides a trusted blockchain network, where participants know
  that all tx can be detected and traced by authorize regulators and auditors.

Consensus:
  Prior to commitment, the peers will employ these system chaincode
  to make sure that enough endorsements are present,
  and that they were derived from the appropriate entities.
  Moreover, a versioning check will take place during which the current state
  of the ledger is agreed or consented upon,
  before any blocks containing transactions are appended to the ledger.
