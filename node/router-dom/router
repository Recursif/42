Single page applications (SPAs) rewrite sections of a page
rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

Twitter is a good example of this type of application.

When you click on a tweet only the tweet's info is fetched from the server.

These apps are easy to deploy and greatly improve the user exp, among other advantages.

However, they also bring challenges.

One of them is browser history.

As the application is contained in a single page,
it cannot rely on the browser's forward/back buttons per se.

It need something that, according to the app state, changes the URL to
push or replace URL history events within the browser.

At the same time, it also needs to rebuil the application state from information contained within the URL.

This is the job of a router.

A router allows your application to navigate between different components,
changing the browser URL, modifying the browser history, and keeping the UI state in sync.

React is a popular library for building SPAs. However, as React focuses only on building user interfaces,
it doesn't have a built-in solution for routing.

React Router is the most popular routing library for React. It allows you define
routes in the sames declarative style.

<Route path="/home" component={Home} />
