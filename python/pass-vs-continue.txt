# pass and continue

pass simply does nothing

continue goes on with the next loop iteration.

Ex:

a = [0, 1, 2]

for element in a:
    if not element:
        pass
    print element
0
1
2

for element in a:
    if not element:
        continue
    print element
1
2


pass is only useful when you
sintactically need an indented suite,
but you want to do nothing.

Ex:

Ignore some exception:

except SomeException: pass
