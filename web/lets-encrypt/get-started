# Let's encrypt

To enable HTTPS on your website, you need to get a certificate (a type of file)
from a Certificate Authority (CA).

Let's encrypt is a CA. In order to get a certificate for your website's domain from
Let's Encrypt, you have to demonstrate control over the domain.

With Let's Encrypt, you do using software that uses the ACME protocole,
whitch typically runs on your web host.

To figure out what method will work best for you,
you will need to know whether you have a shell access (also known as SSH access),
to your web host.

If you manage your website entirely through a control panel
like cPanel, Plesk, or WordPress, there's a good chance you don't have shell access.

You can ask your hosting provider to be sure. lol


## With Shell Access (for dev en fact)

We recommend that most people with shell access use the Certbot ACME client.

It can automate certificate issuance and installation with no downtime. It also
has modes for people who don't want autoconfiguration.
It's easy to use, works on many operating systems and has great doc.

If Certbot does not meet your needs, or you'd like to try something else, there are
many more ACME clients to choose from.
Once you've chosen ACME client software, see the doc that client to proceed.

If youâ€™re experimenting with different ACME clients, use our staging environment to avoid hitting rate limits.
