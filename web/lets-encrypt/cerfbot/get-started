# Install

On Ubuntu systems, the Certbot team maintains a PPA. Once you add it to your list of repositories all you'll need to do is apt-get the following packages.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot


## Get Started

Certbot supports a number of different "plugins" that can be used to obtain and/or install
certificates.

Since your server architecture doesn't yet support automatic installation you'll have to use the certonly command
to obtain your sertificate:

sudo certbot certonly

This will allow you interaticely select the plugin and options used to obtain your sertificate.

If you already have a webserver running,we recommend choosing the "webroot" plugin.

To obtain a cert using the "webroot" plugin, which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:

sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is

This command will obtain a single cert for example.com www.example.com, thing.is, and m.thing.is;
it will places files below  /var/www/example to prove control of the first two domains,
and under /var/www/thing for the second pair.

To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for example.com and www.example.com:

$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com


## Automating renewal

The certbot packages on your system come with a cron job that will renew your certificates automatically before expire.

Since let's Encrypt certificates last for 90 days, it's highly advisable
to take advantage of this feature.

You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

 $ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
