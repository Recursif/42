Introduction:

Installation requires Git and triggers git clone for each configured repository to ~/.vim/bundle/ by default. Curl is required for search.

If you are using Windows, go directly to Windows setup. If you run into any issues, please consult the FAQ. See Tips for some advanced configurations.

Using non-POSIX shells, such as the popular Fish shell, requires additional setup. Please check the FAQ.
