Assets : Asset definition enable the exchange of almost anything
with monetary value over the network.

Assets are represented in Hyperledger Fabric as a collection of key-value pairs, with state changes recorded as transactions on a Channel ledger. Assets can be represented in binary and/or JSON form.

Chaincode: Chaincode execution is partitioned from tx
ordering, limiting the required levels of trust and verification
across node types, and optimizing network scabilibility and performance.

Chaincode is software defining an asset or assets, and the transaction instructions for modifying the asset(s).




Leadger features : Thes immutable, shared ledger encodes tx history for each channel
and includes SQL-like query capability for efficient auditing and dispute resolution.

Privacy through Channels : Channels enable multi-lateral transactions with the high degrees of privacy and confidentiality

Security and Membership Services : Permissionnned Membership
provides a trusted blockchain network, where participants know
that all tx can be detected and traced by authorize regulators and auditors.

Consensus

 Prior to commitment, the peers will employ these system chaincodes to make sure that enough endorsements are present, and that they were derived from the appropriate entities.
 Moreover, a versioning check will take place during which the current state of the ledger is agreed or consented upon, before any blocks containing transactions are appended to the ledger.
