Flux

Rdeux was inspired by several important qualities of Flux.
Like Flux, Redux prescribes that you concentrate your model update
logic in a certain layer of your app ("stores" in Flux "reducers" in Redux).
Instead of letting the app code directly mutate the data both tell you to describe
every mutation as a plain object called an "action".

Unlike Flux, redux does not have the coincept of Dispatcher.
Relly on pure functions instead of event emitters.
